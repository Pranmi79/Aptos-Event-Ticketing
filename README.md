# 🎟️ Event Ticketing Smart Contract (Aptos Move)

## 📌 Description
This project implements a **simple Event Ticketing system on the Aptos blockchain** using the Move language.  
It allows students to mint NFT-like tickets for college fests with **anti-scalping rules** (one ticket per user) and **verifiable check-ins** (no duplicate entries).

The contract contains only **two main functions**:
- `mint_ticket`: Mint a ticket (one per user).
- `check_in`: Verify entry by marking the ticket as used.

---

## 🌍 Vision
The vision of this project is to **digitize event ticketing for college fests** in a transparent, secure, and decentralized way.  
By leveraging blockchain, tickets become **tamper-proof, transferable with rules, and verifiable on-chain**.

---

## 🚀 Future Scope
- Add event organizer role to issue tickets instead of direct self-minting.
- Enable ticket transfers with restrictions (resale prevention / capped resale price).
- Integration with Aptos Wallets for easy student onboarding.
- Build a frontend dApp for seamless ticket booking and QR-based check-in.
- Support for multiple events with different ticket categories.
